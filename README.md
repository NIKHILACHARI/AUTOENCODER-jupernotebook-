# AUTOENCODER-jupernotebook-
 AIM : Training a machine learning generator model.  given any image with jpeg artefact, it is able to remove them and should be able to generate non artefact images in output. 
 Dataset : training dataset is benn used by DIV2K .The DIV2K datasets contain only high-resolution images  having no jpeg artefact.
 MODEL : AUTOENCODEER MODEL USING TENSORFLOW AND KERAS WITH NEURAL NETWORKS. 
 TEST : FOR TESTING THE folder containing 6 low quality images where used that is provided in the respository.
 result : the result is also attached in the repository NAMED ouput_test_image that contains 6 images which has high resolution than that of the provided test images
